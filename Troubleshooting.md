  1. **Problem:** with Adobe Flash Player on Mac OS X, it does not detect the camera "Built-in iSight" if you have installed Google Video Chat plugin. The problem is even after I changed my code to select the new camera name, it does not work well on Mac OS X.
    * The best option for now is to remove Google Video Chat and make sure that your Flash Player settings show only one camera "Built-in iSight", or
    * go back to older version of Flash Player `10.0.45` which uses "USB Video Class Video" as camera name.

    * Please see another [forum post](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12579808) on the problem and potential fix.
    * Some people have suggested installing Flash Player [10.2 beta](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html) but that caused newer problems for me.
